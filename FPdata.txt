11	The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is a collection of twelve short stories by Arthur Conan Doyle, first published on 14 October 1892. It contains the earliest short stories featuring the consulting detective Sherlock Holmes, which had been published in twelve monthly issues of The Strand Magazine from July 1891 to June 1892. The stories are collected in the same sequence, which is not supported by any fictional chronology. The only characters common to all twelve are Holmes and Dr. Watson and all are related in first-person narrative from Watson's point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\nContains:\r\n[Scandal in Bohemia](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL14930611W/A_Scandal_in_Bohemia)\r\n[Red-headed League](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL14930336W/The_Red-Headed_League)\r\n[Case of Identity](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL14929939W/A_Case_of_Identity)\r\n[Boscombe Valley Mystery](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL18495288W/The_Boscombe_Valley_Mystery)\r\n[Five Orange Pips](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL1518120W/Five_Orange_Pips)\r\n[Man with the Twisted Lip](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL14930258W/The_Man_With_the_Twisted_Lip)\r\n[Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL1518317W/Adventure_of_the_Blue_Carbuncle)\r\n[Adventure of the Speckled Band](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL262561W/Adventure_of_the_Speckled_Band)\r\n[Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL1518318W/Adventure_of_the_Engineer's_Thumb)\r\n[Adventure of the Noble Bachelor](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL14929841W/Adventure_of_the_Noble_Bachelor)\r\n[Adventure of the Beryl Coronet](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL14929825W/Adventure_of_the_Beryl_Coronet)\r\n[Adventure of the Copper Beeches](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL1518116W/Adventure_of_the_Copper_Beeches)\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nAlso contained in:\r\n\r\n - [Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL1518128W)\r\n - [Adventures of Sherlock Holmes](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL20624138W)\r\n - [Celebrated Cases of Sherlock Holmes](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL16076930W)\r\n - [Complete Sherlock Holmes](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL18188824W)\r\n - [Complete Sherlock Holmes: Volume I](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL14929975W)\r\n - [Illustrated Sherlock Holmes](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL1518342W)\r\n - [Obras completas de Conan Doyle: II](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL20787319W)\r\n - [Original Illustrated Sherlock Holmes](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL262528W)\r\n - [Original Illustrated 'Strand' Sherlock Holmes](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL262529W)\r\n - [Short Stories](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL18188661W)\r\n - [Works](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL16173818W)\r\n - [Works](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL14930383W)	\N	\N	\N	\N

13	Roverandom is a novella written by J.R.R. Tolkien, originally told in 1925. It deals with the adventures of a young dog, Rover. In the story, an irritable wizard turns Rover into a toy, and Rover goes to the moon and under the sea in order to find the wizard again to turn him back into a normal-sized dog. The author wrote Roverandom for his son Michael Tolkien to amuse him upon the loss of his favorite toy — a little leaden dog. The work is in tone a children's story, but contains many allusions and references in the manner of "Farmer Giles of Ham".	\N	\N	\N	\N
14	From NYU Wagner: \r\n\r\nAt some point, every one of us embarks on a journey to find love. We meet people, date, get into and out of relationships, all with the hope of finding someone with whom we share a deep connection. This seems standard now, but it’s wildly different from what people did even just decades ago. Single people today have more romantic options than at any point in human history. With technology, our abilities to connect with and sort through these options are staggering. So why are so many people frustrated?	\N	\N	\N	\N

16	Hardy's last work of fiction, Jude the Obscure is also one of his most gloomily fatalistic, depicting the lives of individuals who are trapped by forces beyond their control. Jude Fawley, a poor villager, wants to enter the divinity school at Christminster. Sidetracked by Arabella Donn, an earthy country girl who pretends to be pregnant by him, Jude marries her and is then deserted. He earns a living as a stonemason at Christminster; there he falls in love with his independent-minded cousin, Sue Bridehead. Out of a sense of obligation, Sue marries the schoolmaster Phillotson, who has helped her. Unable to bear living with Phillotson, she returns to live with Jude and eventually bears his children out of wedlock. Their poverty and the weight of society's disapproval begin to take a toll on Sue and Jude; the climax occurs when Jude's son by Arabella hangs Sue and Jude's children and himself. In penance, Sue returns to Phillotson and the church. Jude returns to Arabella and eventually dies miserably. The novel's sexual frankness shocked the public, as did Hardy's criticisms of marriage, the university system, and the church. Hardy was so distressed by its reception that he wrote no more fiction, concentrating solely on his poetry.Please Note:  This book is easy to read in true text, not scanned images that can sometimes be difficult to decipher.  The Microsoft eBook has a contents page linked to the chapter headings for easy navigation. The Adobe eBook has bookmarks at chapter headings and is printable up to two full copies per year.
